    This is an R/Shiny app for visualisation of single cell RNA-seq (scRNASeq) data. Based on a provided Seurat object, one or more genes can be selected through a user interface, and several plots are generated, including feature plots, ridge plots, violin plots and dot plots. This project is based on <a href="https://github.com/ktrns/scrnaseq">scrnaseq</a>. The scrnaseq workflow was and is being developed by <a href="https://github.com/ktrns">Katrin Sameith</a> and <a href="https://github.com/andpet0101">Andreas Petzold</a> at the <a href="https://genomecenter.tu-dresden.de/about-us">DRESDEN-concept Genome Center (Dresden, Germany)</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.mhh.de/genomics">Research Core Unit Genomics (Hannover, Germany)</a>.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![screenshot](https://github.com/MHH-RCUG/scrnaseq_app/blob/master/www/screenshot.PNG)
This app is dependent on data generated by Seurat, which must be run first. The app reads an .rds file which contains the Seurat object and all associated data.  The user can then select genes through a list or an Excel file (.xlsx). The expression of these genes is then displayed in a) t-SNE plots b) Ridge plots c) violin plots or d) dot plots. The generated plots can then be downloaded in .pdf and .png format. 

### Built With

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [Shiny from RStudio](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
* [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/)



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To get the app running, you need to follow these simple steps.

### Upload .rds file
First, you need to upload an .rds file containing your Seurat object. If you do not have this file yet but would still like to try the app, you can use this [example](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/rRawkhIOVe1T5qi).

### Select genes

#### Select genes through the user interface
Once the .rds file is uploaded and processed, you can click on the field below `Genes` and select your genes by clicking or searching. To delete genes again, you have to click on the gene and hit the backspace key.

#### Select genes through an Excel file with header
You can select genes by uploading an .xlsx file ([example](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/ZwY0iVPji6uBVKO)).  
The spreadsheet has to look as follows:

| Ensembl_IDs | Gene_Names |
| :--- | :--- |
| First ID  | First Name |
| Second ID | Second Name |

The app will only read the first column including the Ensembl IDs. The second column `Genes` is optional.

#### Select genes through an Excel file without header
If your .xlsx file contains no header, please uncheck the checkbox. Otherwise, the first Ensembl ID will not show up in the selection.

### Aspect Ratio
In order to change the aspect ratio of the plots you can change the pixels of the x and y-axis. By clicking on `Default settings for axes` the default settings will be restored: `X = 1024px`and `Y = 576px`

### Download
Once the plots are generated, you can download them. The download is an archive which contains a **PDF and PNG** version of the selected plots.
If you want to rename your archive before downloading, you can do so in the given field.

### Troubleshooting

  * Should the app hang or stop responding, you can reset it by reloading the data (RDS file) into the app.
